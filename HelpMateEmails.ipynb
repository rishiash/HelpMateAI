His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months \\nago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are \\nexpected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention \\nsignificant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the \\n$600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve \\ngrowth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to \\ndemonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and \\nreserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a \\nsignificant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The \\nconcentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a \\nvery poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable \\nstrategy to maximize the exit value).\\n\\nI would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:\\n a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and\\n b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.\\n\\nOtherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to \\nsell tha asset.\\n\\nI hope this meets with your approval.\\n\\nRegards\\nDelainey\\n\",\n          \"Can you send me an example?\\n\\nStacey\\n\\n \",\n          \"Attached is an updated phone list for the group.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=  =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron=01,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=  of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.  Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=  =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron=01,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=  of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.  Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional\\n comments/suggestions ; Time Stamp: 2000-12-29 05:47:00 ; From: Alan Comnes ; To: ['Paul Kaufman'] ; Body: Steve, Jeff, and others: .  Here are some of my thoughts:  Power price strip.  The power prices pulled together from the Davis-Lay  meeting are based on a weighted average of off- and on-peak prices.  We can  easily show on- and off-peak prices  separately.  We're making a FERC filing  on Tues showing l-t prices so we can pull peak/off peak from that data.   Note, however, that \\\"baseload\\\" power is equivalent to 24x7x365 power, which  is what we provided him.  In terms of my other reactions:  Not enough DSM.  The best analysis of the West trading desk is that we are in  a temporary, WSCC-wide energy shortage, not a capacity shortage.  Anything  that reduces kWh demand will leave more water behind dams and natural gas  storage.  This will translate into lower market prices.  Until more natural  gas supply, generating capacity, and rainfall comes along, we will see high  prices.  If Davis is unwilling to raise rates, he should be willing to take  some extraordinary measures to cut demand.  At a minimum, there should be  expanded pay-for-curtailment curtailment programs.  Voluntary Opt Out of Rate Freeze  I have not thought through all the EES  implications but one thing that could be \\\"sold\\\" to customers is to give them  the option of buying an interval meter and pay the current market price of  power.  That would empower them to modify demand and not incur ongoing,  increasing stranded cost liability.  Muni's need to get involved.  I assume that Enron won't take a position on  requiring muni's to sell generation in California but Enron should support  having muni's be cajoled to participate in demand reduction programs for the  reasons noted above.  As recently as 12/23 Freeman said there was no need to  conserve at LADWP.  Pretty irresponsible.  Tie Govt Backings with Move to Cost-Based Prices.  Securitization and state  credit guarantees are great ways to lower the cost of money to the utilties  in this crisis.  However, both are irresponsible actions unless there is  a  plan to move retail rates to a level that covers the full cost of power.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other \\\"nonadvocates\\\" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere \\\"brainstorming\\\".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \\\"couple\\\" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme.  WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THIS.  MUST DEAL WITH CREDIT ISSUES IN OUR LIFE  TIME.  NOTE THAT WE ARE TALKING TO SCE ABOUT A TOLLING AGT FROM LV COGEN.   CREDIT ISSUES ARE OPEN.  Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time.  THIS IS DONE NOW BY THE ISO  Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.  DO NOT THINK THIS WILL GO TOO FAR AS EMISSIONS OFFSETS ARE A FEDERAL ISSUE.   HOWEVER, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE STATE COULD DO TO PROMOTE ERCS  (SEE PREVIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED WITH STATE OFFICIALS, INCLUDING STEVENS, ET  AL.  SORRY I DO NOT HAVE THE DOC ON MY VACATION.  ASK SAM FOR A COPY OF HIS  SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS.)  THIS PROMOTION COULD BE CONDITIONED ON SELLING IN  STATE.  Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here).  NICE SCAPEGOAT.  Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators.  REQUIRING IN STATE SALE IS PROBALY RESTRAINT OF TRADE.  HOWEVER, GETTING THE  SAME OUTCOME THROUGH INCENTINVES, EG, LONG TERM CONTRACTS, IS BETTER.   (CONFIDENTIALLY, I KNOW THAT AES IS NEGOTIATING A PPA WITH SCE FOR ITS MOJAVE  PLANT, I PRESUME AS A CONDITION TO CONTINUING TO GET TO BUY IT.  THAT IS  FINE.)  Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.  SEE MY COMMENTS RE FRANK VICKERS EMAIL.  TO THE POINT, CANNOT SECURITIZE IF  HAVE A PHONY SRAC, IE., ONE BASED ON WACOG.  IF PUT IT BACK TO BORDER INDEX  GAS BASED SRAC, CAN SECURITIZE EASILY.  To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal.  I DO NOT KNOW AB OUT YOU, BUT I THINK IT IS A COP OUT THAT \\\"THE UTILITIES ARE  THE BLAME FOR THIS AND SHOULD TAKE ALL THE BRUNT FOR THE HIGH PRICES\\\".   NOTWITHSTANDING FLORIOS COMMENTS THAT \\\"HE WAS ALWAYS AGAINST DEREGULATION\\\", I  THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DEREGULATION:   VERY HIGH LOAD GROWTH, NO GENERATION BUILT FOR YEARS (THAT WAS PROBABLY THE  PROBLEM OF THE REGULATED REGIME), LOW HYDRO IN NW, HIGH GROWTH IN ADJACENT  STATES, ETC.  I THINK IF GOV WAS HONEST WITH CONSUMERS (NO RATE INCREASE FOR  5 YEARS - IT IS NOW TIME...) THAT CONSUMERS WOULD BE OK WITH INCREASE.  MY  BIGGEST SUGGESTION IS TO THAT WHATEVER IS DONE IS DONE IN CONTEXT OF AN  OVERALL PLAN THAT ACCOMODATES UTILITY CREDIT, RATE INCREASES, GENERATION,  ETC., ETC,  EACH PARTY DOES NOT HAVE TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING, BUT IF  EVERYONE CAN SEE THE WHOLE PLAN, THEN I BELIEVE THINGS WILL WORK.  He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.

Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been  available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis  and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive  action.   Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on  our financial condition.

The only ENE listing in the filing is ENE Canada at $28M.    The other thing that Governor and his PUC could have done many months ago was  realign rates to more accurately reflect the real cost of power.

If others don't have it and  want it, let me know and I'll fax it.  The filing's brief--about 10  pages--with more detail apparently to be filed.  It lists the top 20  creditors.  The only ENE listing in the filing is ENE Canada at $28M.    The other thing that Governor and his PUC could have done many months ago was  realign rates to more accurately reflect the real cost of power.  That  arguably was a key determinant driving PG&E to Bankruptcy.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional\\n comments/suggestions ; Time Stamp: 2000-12-29 05:47:00 ; From: Alan Comnes ; To: ['Paul Kaufman'] ; Body: Steve, Jeff, and others: .  Here are some of my thoughts:  Power price strip.  The power prices pulled together from the Davis-Lay  meeting are based on a weighted average of off- and on-peak prices.  We can  easily show on- and off-peak prices  separately.  We're making a FERC filing  on Tues showing l-t prices so we can pull peak/off peak from that data.   Note, however, that \\\"baseload\\\" power is equivalent to 24x7x365 power, which  is what we provided him.  In terms of my other reactions:  Not enough DSM.  The best analysis of the West trading desk is that we are in  a temporary, WSCC-wide energy shortage, not a capacity shortage.  Anything  that reduces kWh demand will leave more water behind dams and natural gas  storage.  This will translate into lower market prices.  Until more natural  gas supply, generating capacity, and rainfall comes along, we will see high  prices.  If Davis is unwilling to raise rates, he should be willing to take  some extraordinary measures to cut demand.  At a minimum, there should be  expanded pay-for-curtailment curtailment programs.  Voluntary Opt Out of Rate Freeze  I have not thought through all the EES  implications but one thing that could be \\\"sold\\\" to customers is to give them  the option of buying an interval meter and pay the current market price of  power.  That would empower them to modify demand and not incur ongoing,  increasing stranded cost liability.  Muni's need to get involved.  I assume that Enron won't take a position on  requiring muni's to sell generation in California but Enron should support  having muni's be cajoled to participate in demand reduction programs for the  reasons noted above.  As recently as 12/23 Freeman said there was no need to  conserve at LADWP.  Pretty irresponsible.  Tie Govt Backings with Move to Cost-Based Prices.  Securitization and state  credit guarantees are great ways to lower the cost of money to the utilties  in this crisis.  However, both are irresponsible actions unless there is  a  plan to move retail rates to a level that covers the full cost of power.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other \\\"nonadvocates\\\" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere \\\"brainstorming\\\".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \\\"couple\\\" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THIS.  MUST DEAL WITH CREDIT ISSUES IN OUR LIFE  TIME.  NOTE THAT WE ARE TALKING TO SCE ABOUT A TOLLING AGT FROM LV COGEN.   CREDIT ISSUES ARE OPEN.  Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time.  THIS IS DONE NOW BY THE ISO  Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.  DO NOT THINK THIS WILL GO TOO FAR AS EMISSIONS OFFSETS ARE A FEDERAL ISSUE.   HOWEVER, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE STATE COULD DO TO PROMOTE ERCS  (SEE PREVIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED WITH STATE OFFICIALS, INCLUDING STEVENS, ET  AL.  SORRY I DO NOT HAVE THE DOC ON MY VACATION.  ASK SAM FOR A COPY OF HIS  SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS.)  THIS PROMOTION COULD BE CONDITIONED ON SELLING IN  STATE.  Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here).  NICE SCAPEGOAT.  Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators.  REQUIRING IN STATE SALE IS PROBALY RESTRAINT OF TRADE.  HOWEVER, GETTING THE  SAME OUTCOME THROUGH INCENTINVES, EG, LONG TERM CONTRACTS, IS BETTER.   (CONFIDENTIALLY, I KNOW THAT AES IS NEGOTIATING A PPA WITH SCE FOR ITS MOJAVE  PLANT, I PRESUME AS A CONDITION TO CONTINUING TO GET TO BUY IT.  THAT IS  FINE.)  Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.  SEE MY COMMENTS RE FRANK VICKERS EMAIL.  TO THE POINT, CANNOT SECURITIZE IF  HAVE A PHONY SRAC, IE., ONE BASED ON WACOG.  IF PUT IT BACK TO BORDER INDEX  GAS BASED SRAC, CAN SECURITIZE EASILY.  To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal.  I DO NOT KNOW AB OUT YOU, BUT I THINK IT IS A COP OUT THAT \\\"THE UTILITIES ARE  THE BLAME FOR THIS AND SHOULD TAKE ALL THE BRUNT FOR THE HIGH PRICES\\\".   NOTWITHSTANDING FLORIOS COMMENTS THAT \\\"HE WAS ALWAYS AGAINST DEREGULATION\\\", I  THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DEREGULATION:   VERY HIGH LOAD GROWTH, NO GENERATION BUILT FOR YEARS (THAT WAS PROBABLY THE  PROBLEM OF THE REGULATED REGIME), LOW HYDRO IN NW, HIGH GROWTH IN ADJACENT  STATES, ETC.  I THINK IF GOV WAS HONEST WITH CONSUMERS (NO RATE INCREASE FOR  5 YEARS - IT IS NOW TIME...) THAT CONSUMERS WOULD BE OK WITH INCREASE.  MY  BIGGEST SUGGESTION IS TO THAT WHATEVER IS DONE IS DONE IN CONTEXT OF AN  OVERALL PLAN THAT ACCOMODATES UTILITY CREDIT, RATE INCREASES, GENERATION,  ETC., ETC,  EACH PARTY DOES NOT HAVE TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING, BUT IF  EVERYONE CAN SEE THE WHOLE PLAN, THEN I BELIEVE THINGS WILL WORK.  He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.    \",\n          \"Subject: Response Statement to PG&E's Ch. 11 Filing ; Time Stamp: 2001-04-06 06:37:00 ; From: Eric Thode ; To: ['Karen Denne'] ; Body: I have returned a call to Gary Gentile from the AP.

Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been  available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis  and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive  action.   Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on  our financial condition.

If others don't have it and  want it, let me know and I'll fax it.  The filing's brief--about 10  pages--with more detail apparently to be filed.  It lists the top 20  creditors.  The only ENE listing in the filing is ENE Canada at $28M.    The other thing that Governor and his PUC could have done many months ago was  realign rates to more accurately reflect the real cost of power.  That  arguably was a key determinant driving PG&E to Bankruptcy.
